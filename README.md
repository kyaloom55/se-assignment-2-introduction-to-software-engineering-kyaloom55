# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

It is a systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools  to develop and maintain softwares. it is application of engineering principles to design, develop and maintain softwares 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is sytematic and complex proccess involving many experts like developers, designers,testers and  project managers. Traditional programming focused mainly on developing codes to solve specific task. It  was ad hoc without structured planning or design usually involveng few people. 

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

step 1 : Requirements- involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Step 2: Design: creating designs of software architecture and user interface. 
Step 3: Implementation- Writing codes 
Step 4: Testing- Running test to ascertain the software's functionality and its quality.
Step 5: Deployment- relesaing software to the users or customers.
Step 6: Maintenance - providing support, updates, and enhncement after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

The two are software development methodologies.
Differences.
Agile is iterative and incremental while waterfall i sequential with phases falling downwards.
Agile is highly flexible while waterfall is rigid and less adaptable 
In agile customers are highly involved while in waterfall theres is less cutomer involvement.  

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirement engineering is a software development process that involves systematic identifying, documenting and mananging the requirements of a software. 

Processes of requirement engineering. 
Elicitation: Gathers requirements from stakeholders.  
Analysis : refines and prioritizes the gathered requirements.
Specification : documents the requiremnts in a detailed and structured format.
Validation : ensures that the documented requirements meet the stakeholder needs and expectation. 
Manangement: Manages changes and maintain the integrity throughout the project lifecycle.

Importance of requirements engineering in softwaredevelopment lifecycle
Ensures alignment with stakeholder needs.
Reduces risks and errors. 
Improves project planning and manangement.
Enhances communication an collaboration. 
Ensures quality and satisfaction. 
Facilitates better design and development.
Supports maintenance and evolution.
Ensures efficiency in cost and time. 
  
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Concept of modularity 
Its design principle that breaks down system into smaller manangeable and  interchangeable components.
It improves maintainabilty and scalability of a software as it allows isolated expansion, parallel development, load distribution, isolation of changes simplified understanding and flexible updates . 

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing : tests functionality of individual components.
Integration testing :tests interaction between different components and subsystems. 
System testing: tests the entire system as a whole.
Acceptance tsting : It tests user experiences.

Importance of software testing
Ensures quality
Enhances reliability 
Prevents failure
Facilitates maintenance
Increases security
IMproves user experience
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version Controls 
Are tools that help manange changes in a source code. They help developers collaborate and cordinate and track modifications in a project.  Eg GIT, SUBVERSIONS
Importance of VCS
Allows collaboration 
History tracking
Back-up and recovery
Branching and merging
Audit and compliance 

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Roles of a project manager
Project planning and execution
Stakeholder management.
Team leadership.
Risk manangement. 
Quality assurance.

challenges faced in managing software projects 
Technical challenges 
Organisational challenges
Process and methodology 
Communication challenges 

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance 
It is a ongoing process of managing and updating software after deployment. Involves modifications, enhancements and fixes to software to ensure it continues meeting user expections.

Types of maintenance activities
Bug fixing 
Enhancements
Performance optimization
Compatibility updates
Documentation 
Regression.

Importance of software maintenance
Sustained value 
User satisfaction 
Risk mitigation 
Cost effeciency 

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Ethical issues in software engineering. 
Privacy and data protection 
Data breaches and security vulnerabilities.
Bias and discrimnination. 
Professional integrity conduct
Intellectual property and open source
Soial impact and responsibilities.
